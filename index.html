          <h1>on the search for a home</h1>
          <p>
            People and animals, on the East Side and everywhere else, seek the comfort of a home. Like the dog in 'Valiance,' we defend our homes - if we have them - with tooth and nail. Like the cat in 'Temporary,' we find a place to call home based on compassion and kindness, not necessarily through the physical attributes of a house. Our homes may be surrounded, like that of the dove in 'Focus,' by barbed wire. They may be close to the one who feeds us, like the pidgeons on the roof in 'Morning.' We fly through the ether, like the bird in 'Liberty,' but we work our whole lives to make sure we have somewhere to return. These images are all in the mind of the man in 'Dreamer' - the man who is still on the search for a home.
